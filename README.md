# Google_tire_ads

Background: In early February 2021, I was given a case study as apart of a job interview.  The dataset came from a client's google ads marketing.  The dataset was redacted by them and is not being made public by me, because even tho I never signed an NDA I believe that keeping this dataset private for the customer's sake is the ethically correct thing to do.  While one might be able to get some of that data from this repository, it will be limited and incomplete.

Original Task was read as such: "Given this data, and any other information you want to add, what can you tell us? What information/visualizations can we share with the customer to help them position/re-position etc. How are people finding their products, and what can we do with this information?"
